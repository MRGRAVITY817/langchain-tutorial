      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 cup cooked white rice\n",
      "- 1 carrot, julienned\n",
      "- 1 zucchini, julienned\n",
      "- 1 cup spinach\n",
      "- 1 cup bean sprouts\n",
      "- 2 eggs\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 2 tbsp soy sauce\n",
      "- 1 tbsp sesame oil\n",
      "- 1 tbsp vegetable oil\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Gochujang (Korean chili paste), to taste (optional)\n",
      "- Sesame seeds, for garnish\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Cook the rice according to package instructions and set aside.\n",
      "2. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, and minced garlic to make the sauce.\n",
      "3. Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the carrots and zucchini, and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n",
      "4. In the same pan, add the spinach and bean sprouts. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n",
      "5. In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up or to your desired doneness.\n",
      "6. To assemble the Bibimbap, divide the cooked rice into bowls. Arrange the cooked vegetables and fried eggs on top of the rice.\n",
      "7. Drizzle the sauce over the Bibimbap and add a dollop of Gochujang if desired.\n",
      "8. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top for garnish.\n",
      "9. Mix everything together before eating to combine all the flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your homemade Bibimbap!For a vegetarian version of Bibimbap, you can make a few simple ingredient swaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Eggs**: You can replace the eggs with a vegan alternative such as scrambled tofu or a vegan egg substitute. To make scrambled tofu, crumble firm tofu in a pan and season it with a bit of turmeric for color and salt and pepper for flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Soy Sauce**: Make sure to use a vegetarian or vegan soy sauce to keep the dish vegetarian-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gochujang (Korean chili paste)**: Most Gochujang brands are vegetarian, but it's always good to double-check the ingredients. If you can't find a vegetarian version, you can substitute it with a mixture of sriracha and miso paste for a similar flavor profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sesame Oil**: Sesame oil is a key flavor in Bibimbap, but if you don't have it or prefer not to use it, you can substitute it with a neutral oil like grapeseed or avocado oil. You can also add a few drops of toasted sesame oil for a similar nutty flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Vegetables**: Feel free to customize the vegetables in the Bibimbap based on your preferences. You can add mushrooms, bell peppers, or any other vegetables you enjoy. Just make sure to julienne or slice them thinly for quick stir-frying.\n",
      "\n",
